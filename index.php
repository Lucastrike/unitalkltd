						When Specialfriends.com was launched several years ago as a Safer Social Network for people of all abilities it attracted thousands of members from over 55 countries around the world. Its members not only felt a little safer than some other sites but it also offered them the chance to meet new friends who understood them. Specialfriends has several levels of security and a group of people who have not only built quick friendships but in some cases everlasting.

						The site is currently going through a revamp to attract more likeminded people, add several new features, but at the same time keep it friendly and fun.</p>

					UniTalk are proud to partner with Keep Children Safe Online CIC a nonprofit organisation that teaches children how to stay safe on the internet. Using our protected TouchPhrase Technology we have created a safe and secure chat room for their members called 'MonkeyChat'. Children as young as 4 can enter this totally safe chat room, which is made up of pre-set phrases and enjoy talking to friends around the world about a wide range of subjects, some educational, some very silly but all within a safe and fun environment. This also educates children for when they start using other adult Social Networks.</p>
